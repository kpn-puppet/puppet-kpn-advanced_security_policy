## Overview
This module sets and enforces the advanced security policies for windows.
We used Paul Cannons Local Security Policy as a 'blueprint' to read the policies from a template.

## Module Description
This module uses LGPO.exe (v2.2) to configure the advanced security policies on Windows. 
LGPO.exe is a command-line utility that is designed to help automate management of
Local Group Policy. It can import and apply settings from Registry Policy (Registry.pol)
files, security templates, Advanced Auditing backup files, as well as from formatted
“LGPO text” files.

## Setup

### Setup Requirements

This module requires:
- ADMX and ADML files with the policy settings to be set (in `C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions`)
- LGPO.exe needs to be installed in `C:\Windows\System32` (Add the following code)
  ```puppet
    include advanced_security_policy
  ```

### What advanced_security_policy affects
- Advanced security policies.
- `C:\Windows\System32\GroupPolicy\Machine\Registry.pol`

### Beginning with advanced_security_policy
To start using advanced_security_policy, 
simply include the module and add the defined type statements in your profile.
Then configure the policies you want to set. (for example in hiera)

## Usage

### Parameters

#### policy_value
